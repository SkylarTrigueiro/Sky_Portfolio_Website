      <description>Facial Recognition (Work in progress) This project is about training a Siamese neural network to determine if two photos are of the same person.
Data The data used to train the model is the &amp;ldquo;Yale Face Databse&amp;rdquo; which can be found at http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database
References  This project started as a project in the Udemy course &amp;ldquo;Pytorch: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence&amp;rdquo;, which I highly recommend.  </description>

      <description>Cifar-Image Classification Overview In this notebook I am creating an image classifier for the Cifar10 dataset which has an accuracy, precision, and recall of 91%. The Cifar10 dataset consists of 60k 32x32 pixel photos, of which 50k in the training set and 10k were used in the test set. The images are of:
airplanes automobiles birds cats deer dogs frogs horses ships trucks  I&amp;rsquo;m accomplishing this by using a convolutional neural network with a custom architecture.</description>
