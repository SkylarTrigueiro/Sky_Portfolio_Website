      <description>Algorithmic Trading (Work in progress) This project is about trying to develop an intelligent way of following stock market trends to improve returns compared to buying and holding onto stock. However, I seem to have shown that it&amp;rsquo;s easier and better to simply buy stock and hold stock than it is to try and time the market.
Data I will use the performance of large companies contained in the S&amp;amp;P 500 to predict trends.</description>
